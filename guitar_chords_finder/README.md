I'm using this directory to explore a question in guitar: What are all of the ways to comfortably play every relevant cord? At the start I'll just be focusing on the seven normal seventh chords (seen in chord.py). 

The chords I'm looking for should follow the following criteria:
1) They should be one of the chords in that chord.py file.
2) When fingering the chord: each of the four fingers on the fretting hand (index, middle, ring, and pinky) should be either 0 or 1 fret away from it's adjacent finger. This means that a chord can't have the index, middle, and ring fingers on one fret and the pinky finger 2 frets away (for example).
3) If two fingers are on the same fret, then the higher-up finger should be on the lower string. For example, if a chord has both the middle and ring fingers on the 5th fret, then the middle finger should be on the lower string.
