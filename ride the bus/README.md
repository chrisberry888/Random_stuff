"Ride The Bus" is a game involving one dealer and multiple participants.
The dealer begins with a shuffled deck of standard playing cards, and each participant takes a turn. 
On each turn, the dealer deals a maximum of 4 cards to the participant, and before each deal, the participant
needs to make a guess about what the next card will be.
Before the first deal, they need to guess whether the card will be red or black.
Second deal, whether the second card will be higher or lower than the first card.
Third deal, whether the third card will be inside or outside the two other cards.
Fourth deal, what suit the last card will be.
After a participant either guesses incorrectly or guesses all 4 deals correctly, the dealer moves
onto the next participant without shuffling the deck. The dealer keeps going until all cards have been
dealt, or until they move onto a new participant and they have 3 or fewer cards left in the deck.

A participant with good memory would be able to increase their probability of winning by knowing
what cards had already come out. This program is to simulate a game of riding the bus, and to 
give the mathematically optimal guess given all previous cards that have been dealt.
